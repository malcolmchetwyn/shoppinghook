	<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last updated: December 20, 2013</p>

    <p>
    Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully. By downloading, accessing or using the 
    mobile applications, websites or other products or services (collectively, the "Services") of 
    Shoppinghook, Pty Ltd. and our affiliates ("Shoppinghook", "we" or "us"), you agree to be bound by these 
    Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
    We may change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make 
    changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending a 
    notification, posting a notice on the Services or updating the "Last Updated" date above. Your 
    continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage 
    you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply 
    to your use of the Services. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the 
    Services and delete your Shoppinghook account.
    </p>

    <h2>Have Fun</h2>
    <p>
    The language below is meant to support this rule. It allows us to continue providing and improving 
    our Services, and it helps to ensure that a few mean users don't ruin the fun for everyone else. 
    Your part in that is simple. Just use common sense—keep sending awesome Hooks to your 
    friends, and please don't send Hooks that they don't want to receive.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Audience</h2>
    <h5>This section is about who can use Shoppinghook.</h5>

    <p>
    Shoppinghook is intended for use by people who are 13 years of age or older, and persons under 
    the age of 13 are prohibited from creating Shoppinghook accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
    You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess 
    legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, 
    conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms, 
    and to abide by and comply with these Terms. In addition, you affirm that you have not been 
    previously suspended or removed from the Services and do not have more than one Shoppinghook 
    account.
    </p>

    <p>
    We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity. We may, 
    without notice and in our sole discretion, terminate your right to use the Services, or any portion 
    of thereof, and block or prevent your future access to and use of the Services or any portion 
    thereof.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage Data</h2>
    <h5>This section is about data we collect.</h5>

    <p>
    By using the Shoppinghook application you agree to let Shoppinghook collect information about your usage 
    of the application, including interactions with Hooks. For example, when you open a message or 
    capture a screenshot of a Hook, we attempt to detect those interactions. You agree that we will 
    share the fact that you took these actions with the sender of the message. You also agree to let 
    Shoppinghook collect certain types of information from and about your device. For example, if you 
    choose to use our "Find Friends" feature, you agree to let Shoppinghook access the address book on 
    your device and upload data to its servers to sync your contacts and find which of your friends are 
    already Shoppinghook users. For more information about the information we collect from you and your 
    device and Shoppinghook's privacy practices, please review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    and/or store content, including but not limited to photos, videos, text, graphics, items or other

    by others and that you have the ability to control who can access such content by adjusting your 
    privacy settings. You agree to abide by our <a href="http://support.Shoppinghook.com/a/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, which may be updated from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
    You agree that you are solely responsible for your User Content and that Shoppinghook is not 
    responsible or liable for any User Content. While we are not obligated to do so, we reserve the 
    right, and have absolute discretion, to review, screen and delete User Content at any time and for 
    any reason.
    </p>

    <p>
    You retain all ownership rights in your User Content. However, by submitting User Content
