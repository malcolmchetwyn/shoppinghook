	    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: May 5, 2014</p>
        <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Shoppinghook Pty Ltd. and our subsidiaries (collectively, "Shoppinghook") when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
        </p>
        <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
        <h3 class="lead">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>
       We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, use the Services to send or receive a message (a "Hook"), request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your username, password, email address, phone number, age and any other information you choose to provide. 
        </p>
        <p>
        When you send or receive Hooks, we also process and store the contents of the Hooks (such as photos, videos and/or captions) on our servers. The contents of Hooks are also temporarily stored on the devices of recipients. Once the time limit of hte Hook is reached recipients will not be able to view a Hook, the activity screen will only show the winning hook. We cannot guarantee that deletion always occurs within a particular timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your Hooks (e.g., by taking a screenshot). If we are able to detect that the recipient has captured a screenshot of a Hook that you send, we will attempt to notify you. In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access Hooks while still in temporary storage on recipients' devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. You should not use Shoppinghook to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="lead">Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services</h3>
        <p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:</p>
        <div class="list-container">
        <ul>
              <li><b>Usage Information:</b>  When you send or receive Hooks, we collect information about these messages, including the time, date, sender and recipient of the Hook. We also collect information about the number of Hooks sent and received between you and your friends and which friends you exchange Hooks with most frequently.</li>
              <li><b>Log Information:</b> We log information about your use of our websites, including your browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the website you visited before navigating to our websites.</li>

        <p>
        We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <h3>Privacy Settings</h3>

        Through settings in our Services, you can choose whether to accept Hooks only from users you have added to your friends list, or from any other Shoppinghook user who determines your name. If you choose to receive Hooks only from your friends, and a user who is not on your friends list attempts to send you a Hook or add you as a friend, you will receive a notification and have the option of adding the user to your friends list. You can also change who can view your Stories in the settings feature of our Services.

        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>
        Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find friends or to store a Hook in your photo gallery). If you choose to find friends, the names and phone numbers in your device's native phonebook will be transmitted to Shoppinghook. If you later decide to revoke your consent and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications, you can do so by either changing the settings on your device, if this settings option is provided by your device operating system, or by following the standard uninstall process and removing our Services from your device. On iOS devices, you can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the settings on your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>
	When you first launch any features of our Services that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to our collection of this information. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, certain features of our Services will no longer function. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove our Services from your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our website.
        </p>
        <h3>Push Notifications/Alerts</h3>
        <p>
        Shoppinghook may send push notifications or alerts to your device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your device (iOS) or by changing your settings within our Services (Android).
