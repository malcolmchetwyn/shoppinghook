After the user clicks the add button.
1. remove the button and replace with spinner.
2. after a successful fried request has been sent, replace spinner with a tick.

See designs in "Friend-Requests-Screen---Find-Friends-Tab.png". Groups:

Friend 1
Friend 1 Clicked Add Button
Friend 1 After clicked Add Button

and see screen designs.

This should happen in a asynch fashion. The user can press the "add" button (per row) and the same functionality will apply. The user is not blocked waiting for one request to finish before the second request is made.


If the user closes/kills etc. the app. the next time the user opens the app and navigates to the search/find friend screen the app will check the server and only display conacts that are not already friends


The Invite Friends Tab will work the exact same way as when a new user signs up.


The Friend Request Tab will work the same way it does today
